Use Cases and Patterns:

- Use one object which can be expensive to create.
  > For example, logging component used by entire application.
  > SINGLETON

- Produce output where some content is constant and other content varies.
  > For example, different kinds of reports with parts that vary.
  > TEMPLATE
  
- Remove logic from a method so that it can be suplied by the caller.
  > For example, filter a list with criteria specified by the client.
  > STRATEGY
  
- The way objects are created needs to vary.
  > For example, initialized with data from different sources.
  > FACTORY
  
- Objects can be created with multiple options.
  > For example, ordering a laptop with options for CPU, RAM, storage, etc.
  > BUILDER
  
- Creation logic varies so much that many factories would be required.
  > For example, expensive or complex initialization logic.
  > PROTOTYPE
  
- Frequently polling an object to determine when state has changed.
  > For example, need to know when large file has been processed.
  > OBSERVER
  
- Need to traverse a hierarchical data structure.
  > For example, JSON or XML document.
  > COMPOSITE
  
- Need to modify elements of a hierarchical data structure.
  > Update information on some nodes but not others.
  > VISITOR
  
- Need to add behaviors to an object in different combinations.
  > For example, serializing objects in one or more formats (json, xml, csv, etc).
  > DECORATOR
  
- Allow object to execute actions without knowing what parameters are required.
  > For example, records actions that can be executed in a different context.
  > COMMAND
  
- Control access to an object.
  > For example, used cached objects instead of real ones, 
    or control access based on client permissions.
  > PROXY
    
- Control steps in a workflow process.
  > For example, an online bookstore with steps for ordering books.
  > STATE
  
- Separate visual from business logic so that each may be tested independently,
  and graphic designers may work independently from developers.
  > For example, web application, web service, desktop or mobile application.
  > MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER
  > MODEL-VIEW-VIEWMODEL
  
- Isolate an application from the data access layer, so that you can replace
  one data access API with another.
  > For example, web application or web service which communicates with a database
    using an ORM such as Entity Framework or NHibernate.
  > REPOSITORY
  
- Perform transactions which involve multiple repositories.
  > For example, update a Customer and one or more orders at the same time.
  > UNIT OF WORK
  
- Satisfy dependencies used by parts of your application.
  > For example, an application which depends on a web service for state.
  > DEPENDENCY INJECTION (aka INVERSION OF CONTROL)
